## initial-code.cpp
The inital code given to me by my professor, to be edited by me over the course of the semester. This code prompts the user to input coords for the location of a knight on an 8x8 chess board. It then outputs a visual representation of that chessboard with the location of the placed knight represented by an 'X' as well as all valid locations where it can move represented by 'L'

### Instructions: 

Redo the Knight's Tour Project but this time set the functions as a class.

### What I did:

Its literally that easy, just place it within a class, not anything to write home about.

Due: 09/24/2023

### Instructions: 

Separate the knights class from your source file. Put the class in a header file and a class content file.

The program will do the following:

- Ask the user for a starting position.
- Places the knight in that starting position and calculates all legal moves. Each move will be numbered.
- The user will choose a number and the knight will move to that space and recalculate the number of legal moves.
- With each move you will also give the user the option to either start a new game or exit the program.
- The program ends when the user wishes.

### What I did:

Setup the separate files
- the main.cpp (just the main function)
- header.h (initialises the class newClass)
- newclass.cpp (defines the functions within newClass)

Conseptually what I did wasn't too bad, simply put, after setting up the first game, I created a loop where the user would keep inputing numbers that the game had placed on the grid, and move the piece to that location using the same function you use to create a grid.

Nothing really else to it, check the notes within the code if you want to see whats up with it point by point, but it seriously wasnt that bad.
