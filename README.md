# cpp-297-mini-projects
my code as I advance my mini project for my intermediate c++ class

## initial-code.cpp
The inital code given to me by my professor, to be edited by me over the course of the semester. This code prompts the user to input coords for the location of a knight on an 8x8 chess board. It then outputs a visual representation of that chessboard with the location of the placed knight represented by an 'X' as well as all valid locations where it can move represented by 'L'
